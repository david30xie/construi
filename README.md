Construi allows you to use [Docker](http://www.docker.com) containers as your build environment.
This allows a consistent and recreatable build environment on any machine running Construi
and Docker.

This is useful for ensuring consistency between development machines.
It is also useful in a CI environment where you may need to build projects from many different
languages and/or versions (e.g., Java 6, Java 8, Ruby).

## Installation

Construi requires [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) version 1.9 or higher.
It can be installed as a Gem.

```
  > gem install construi
```
